Unsupervised
  Finding hidden structure in unlabeled data. Don't know anything about data.

Supervised
  You have a mapping between input signal and the desired output.
  Then when you get data you use your initial data (mapping, supervisory signal) to put a label on them (put them in correct place, cluster).
