First goal: encapsulate calculations so they are well documented and repeatable.
Then: enhance with outputting so simple way to produce markdown or latex can be achieved (with question text).

HW1.print(:task_1, :part_a)
HW1.print
  task1 = HW1::Task1.new
  task1.solution
    -> part_a, part_b, part_c, part_d
