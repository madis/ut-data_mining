### Pros

1. Easy to understand and implement
2. Fast

### Cons

1. Can't find arbitrary shaped clusters
2. One has to know the number of clusters
3. Choosing initial cluster centers affects results

### DBSCAN

### Pros

1. No need to know cluster centers


### Cons

1. Can't find clusters with highly varying density
2. Requires
